/**
 * @file
 * @brief Enhanced Serial Communication Functions.
 *
 * This file contains a collection of functions and commands designed to facilitate and extend
 * basic serial communication in C++. These functions are intended to simplify the process of
 * setting up, sending, receiving, and managing data over serial connections. The enhancements
 * provided in this header file go beyond the standard library functions, offering more
 * flexibility and control for developers working with serial interfaces.
 *
 * The key functionalities include:
 * - Initialization and configuration of serial ports.
 * - Sending and receiving data over serial connections.
 * - Error handling and diagnostics for serial communication.
 * - Utility functions for managing serial buffers and flow control.
 *
 * The functions in this file are designed to be easy to integrate into various projects,
 * providing a robust foundation for serial communication in embedded systems, networking,
 * or any application that requires serial data transmission.
 *
 * @note This file is a part of a larger project focusing on enhancing serial communication
 *       capabilities in C++ applications.
